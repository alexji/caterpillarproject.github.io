The Caterpillar project is an on-going series of state-of-the-art cosmological simulations focusing on halos similar in mass to that of our own Milky Way. Building on several years of effort by the collaboration, we have simulated several of our overall goal of 70 galaxies similar in mass to the Milky Way. These data will enable us to statistically probe the formation history and evolution of all galaxies of this mass, in particular, that of our very own Milky Way.

Throughout this website we present the key scientific motivations, current progress, images and movies and on-going scientific investigations relating to the Caterpillar suite.

If you are intereted in using the Caterpillar data for your research, please contact us.
