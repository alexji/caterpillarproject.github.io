<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Problem</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">In a universe dominated by cold dark matter (CDM), like the one we </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">live in, galaxies grow hierarchically by accreting smaller objects. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Simulations show that this process is reflected in the abundance of </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">dark matter substructures in the halos of galaxies like the Milky Way, </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">and it is believed that the luminous satellites of our Galaxy are the </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">visible counterparts to at least some of these substructures. The figure below shows a cartoon picture of the distribution of large satellites around the Milky Way today.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A long-standing problem, originally noted by e.g. Moore et al. (1999) and Klypin et al. (1999), is that the observed number of Milky Way satellites appears to be significantly lower than the number of dark matter substructures expected based on the CDM theory (the so-called <em>missing satellite problem</em>). This calls into question the validity of the CDM picture on the scales of individual galaxies. Many ideas have been proposed to reconcile the theory with the observations, including the possibility that the dark matter may instead be dynamically <em>warm</em>, rather than cold (achieved by making the individual dark matter particles less massive). Alternatively, another class of models propose that effects related to feedback from baryonic processes or heating by cosmic radiation fields may inhibit star formation in dark matter halos of sufficiently low mass, rendering them invisible. Either way, a definitive solution to the missing satellite problem will inform our theories of the nature of the dark matter and the assembly of galaxies.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Previous Work</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Progress has been made through detailed studies of different types of dwarf galaxies (ultra-faint, classical dwarf spheroidal, more massive dwarfs such as the Magellanic Clouds), which orbit the Milky Way. Extensive photometric and spectroscopic data of these satellites, paired with the discovery of stellar streams in the Galactic halo arising from past and even ongoing mergers of the massive host with smaller galaxies, have revealed much about the complex nature of the life and times of dwarf galaxies and their role in shaping their parent galaxy. The figure below shows a number of streams that are currently present on the stellar halo of the Milky Way due to past accretion events.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the fact that dwarf galaxies are regarded as <em>simple</em> systems, many of them show extended star formation histories with similar, albeit slower, chemical evolution to the Milky Way (see Tolstoy et al. 2009 for a review). Altogether, the dwarfs are old, gas-less systems, and a tight correlation between the average metallicity and systemic luminosity (Kirby et al. 2008) shows the faintest galaxies in the universe \({\rm(L_{tot}&lt;10^{5}\ L_{\odot})}\) to be the most metal-poor systems \({\rm (\mbox{[Fe/H]}_{ave}\sim-2.6)}\) (note: \({\rm [A/B]=\log(N_{A}/N_{B})-\log(N_{A}/N_{B})_\odot}\) for N atoms of elements A, B, e.g., \(\mbox{[Fe/H]}=-3.0\) is 1/1000 of solar Fe abundance.), comparable only to the most metal-poor stars in the Milky Way halo. While observations of individual stars in the least luminous galaxies are difficult to acquire, ~30% of known stars with \(\mbox{[Fe/H]}&lt;-3.5\) are now found in these systems, with more expected to be found soon in surveys such as Pan-Starrs, Skymapper and LSST. It is unclear how such metal-poor, and presumably old, systems survive until today without being disrupted over time. Nevertheless, it is surprising that the Milky Way overall has so few satellite galaxies when its sister galaxy Andromeda appears to have a significantly larger population signaling a potentially very different assembly history.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While detailed chemical studies of individual stars in Andromeda are out of reach, <em>stellar archaeology</em> has been extensively carried out using metal-poor Milky Way halo stars. Metal-deficient stars  represent easily accessible <em>local equivalents</em> of the high-redshift universe, as they formed at a time when the universe was still young. We are thus provided with a tool to look back in time and study the onset of star and galaxy formation, and the nature of the first stars and supernovae in the early universe. Many of these old fossils have been discovered in the halo of the Galaxy over the past decades, and more will be found soon. The SDSS-SEGUE survey's main goal is the exploration of Galactic structure, and the imminent <em>Skymapper survey</em> (Keller et al. 2007) will greatly expand this effort via a detailed chemical and kinematical characterization of all Galactic halo populations through individual stars, including that of the most metal-poor objects.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Supported by these large-scale survey efforts, the field of near-field cosmology has been catapulted into an <em>excited state</em> because it constrains many astrophysical problems related to galaxy formation. It is thus very timely to extensively pursue research into the oldest stars and stellar populations in the dwarf galaxies. They not only enable us to study the history of galaxies with different masses and luminosities, but also facilitate an in-depth study of what role small(er) galaxies may have played in the build-up of the stellar halo.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Our Motivation</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While considerable advances in near-field cosmology have been made, the new knowledge also uncovered substantial bottlenecks preventing further progress. A prominent example is that the chemical abundances of extremely metal-poor stars with \(\mbox{[Fe/H]}&lt;-2.5\) in <em>all</em> the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies are nearly identical to the halo. This suggests a critical connection between the faintest dwarfs and the <em>building blocks</em> that made the halo of the Milky Way, as well as the chemically primitive first galaxies. Specifically, the abundance similarities indicate that the stellar halo likely assembled from earlier analogs of the surviving dwarfs, in line with the hierarchical growth of galaxies. These measurements provide crucial evidence as to what the origin of the oldest, most metal-poor stars is. However, observations alone will likely not be able to uncover the underlying physical processes needed to conclusively confirm the details of the assembly history of the Milky Way stellar halo, as well as the cosmological origin of the ancient ~13,Gyr old stars which must have formed long before the Milky Way was fully assembled. Tied to this issue is the question of the role of the different types of faint and luminous satellite galaxies in the build-up of large galaxies like the Milky Way and Andromeda, and how observations of the numerous stellar streams can be interpreted within the hierarchical assembly process of the Galaxy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Further progress is restricted primarily by a lack of theoretical understanding of the governing processes that led to the creation of the Milky Way and its satellites. Thus, the primary scientific goal of our proposed simulation campaign is to calculate a new, unprecedentedly large set of highly resolved Milky Way sized halos that will open a new window for carrying out computational near-field cosmology. Of order <strong>70 halos</strong> will enable statistically robust investigation of the cosmic variance of the hierarchical assembly of galaxies, including the Milky Way, making our calculations useful for a large variety of analyses in the years to come.</p>
